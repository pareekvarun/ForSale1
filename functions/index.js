//Check below documentation for new version differences. Old version method "event" and "event.val()" was not working now.

//1. When a new onWrite event is triggered in RealTime database, this function copies the data to ElasticSearch.Process is called (I think) indexing.
//2. Before that, we created a similar index in ElasticSearch repository using put method using PostMan software.
//3. elasticSearchUrl is created when configuration is saved within FireBase Functions console.
//4. Note: Only new events are saved in ElasticSearch, because the above documentation had the method change.after.val() made more sense to me.

  let postData = change.after.val(); //Now (>= v1.0.0) Cloud Functions = data after the write
  let post_id = context.params.post_id;
  
  console.log('Indexing post:', postData);
